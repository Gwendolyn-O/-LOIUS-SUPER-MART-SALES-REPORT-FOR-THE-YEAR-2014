RECOMMENDATION


The following suggestions are made in order to improve overall sales strategy and make the most of the knowledge obtained from the performance of sales agents, based on the extensive analytics from 2014. Lious super mart should recognize and support high achievers like Nancy Freeafer, who demonstrated outstanding sales performance with over $104 million in total sales. Also they should consider implementing a mentorship program where top performers can train and share strategies with their peers.


Secondly, targeted training sessions that focus on best practices for closing deals, building client relationships, and product knowledge, especially in low performing regions like west , east and  south that performed less than 30%.


Additionally, the company should consider focusing marketing efforts in those areas, while exploring opportunities in other cities where representatives may have underperformed.


Finally, Lious super mart should develop an incentive program that rewards not only total sales but also because expanding the product offerings for these high-demand items could drive additional sales in other regions.
